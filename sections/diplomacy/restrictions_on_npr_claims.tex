	There are several situations where NPRs will not make territorial claims:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the NPR and the alien race share a capital system, no claims will be made in the capital system or in any adjacent system
		\item The NPR will not make claims against an alien race with whom it shares a Fixed Relationship due to a Truce Countdown
		\item The NPR will ignore claims from an alien race with whom it shares a Fixed Relationship due to a Truce Countdown and there will be no diplomatic penalty
		\item The NPR will not claim a system if there are alien populations with a total EM signature greater than \( 10\% * (Xenophobia / 100) \) of its own capital's EM signature and also greater than the total EM signatures of any AI populations in that system. The existence of populations will be based on intelligence data rather than current contacts.
	\end{itemize}
	The above is based on the concept that an AI is unlikely to claim a system where it knows there is a good chance that claim will cause a war. Note that from the NPR perspective an 'alien race' includes player races.
