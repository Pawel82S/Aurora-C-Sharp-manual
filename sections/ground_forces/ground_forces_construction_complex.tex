	For C\# Aurora, the Ground Force Training Facility becomes the Ground Force Construction Complex. They remain the same size as a research facility and now require one million population to operate.
	
	The build rate for the complex starts at 250 BP per year and can be increased through research. For example, 500 BP per year is 8000 Research Points and 1000 BP per year is 60,000 Research points.
	
	These changes reflects the amount of effort that will be required to construct, train and support the new ground forces.
