	As you fight alien ground forces, you will gain intelligence on the alien ground unit classes. This intelligence is displayed on the Diplomacy and Intelligence window alongside intelligence on alien ships, classes, sensors and populations.
	
	For each different type of ground unit class you engage, you may gain intelligence if you have your own ground forces on the same ship or system body. New intelligence is gained under the following circumstances:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the alien unit fires on you, you will gain intelligence on its weapons
		\item If you score twenty hits on that type of unit, you will identify its base type (infantry, light vehicle, etc.)
		\item If you penetrate the armour of that type of unit twenty times, you will learn its armour strength
		\item If you destroy twenty of that type, you will learn its hit point
	\end{itemize}
	\textit{I might change the 20x multiplier based on play testing.}
