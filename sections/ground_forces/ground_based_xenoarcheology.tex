	Xenology Teams do not exist in C\# Aurora.
	
	Instead, a new ground unit component (100 tons) provides 0.5 xenoarchaeology points. Ground units with this component may be added to ground formations to provide a xenoarchaeology capability. All formations at the same population with a xenoarchaeology capability will combine their xenoarchaeology points.
	
	The annual chance for a race to successfully translate the alien language and symbology is equal to the xenoarchaeology points on the planet. For example, a Xenoarchaeology Vehicle is created with 2 components, giving it 1 xenoarchaeology point (cost about 9 BP). If a formation has forty such vehicles, the annual chance would be 40\%. The chance in any given construction phase is equal to the \( Annual Chance * Construction Phase Length / Year) \).
