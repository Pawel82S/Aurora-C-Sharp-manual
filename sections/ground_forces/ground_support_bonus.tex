	This is a new bonus in C\# for naval officers commanding fighters on ground support, search \& destroy and flak suppression missions. The to hit chance is modified by the bonus.
	
	The bonus is also used for orbital bombardment support (explained in a future rules post), with the Tactical Officer contributing 100\% of his bonus and the Ship Commander contributing 50\% of his bonus.
