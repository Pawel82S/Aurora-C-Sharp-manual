	n C\#, as in VB6, ground forces are treated as size-1 for the purposes of detection, so are best detected with resolution-1 sensors.
	
	For C\#, the ground forces signature is equal to the total signature of all ground formation elements on a planet, divided by 100.
	\[ Signature Of Each Element = \frac{Unit Size * Unit Number}{Fortification Level * Dominant Terrain Fortification Modifier} \]
	
	In other words, well-fortified ground forces will have a smaller signature than those out in the open, so you won't always know if you face a small force, or a well-fortified larger force.
