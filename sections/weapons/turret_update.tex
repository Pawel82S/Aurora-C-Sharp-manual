	A minor update. The benefits of multiple energy weapons in turrets have been doubled. A twin turret now has a 20\% reduction in crew vs two solo weapons and has a 10\% reduction in gear size. A quad turret has a 40\% reduction in crew vs four solo weapons and has a 20\% reduction in gear size.
	
	In addition, I found an error in the VB6 code for turret design that meant a turret needed four times more armour than a ship of equivalent size. This has been corrected for C\# Aurora, which means armoured turrets are now much more viable.
