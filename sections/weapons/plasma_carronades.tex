	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The development cost of Plasma Carronade focal size has been halved. For example, a 30cm Carronade is now 4000 RP.
		\item The building cost of Carronades has also been halved.
	\end{enumerate}
	These two changes should make Carronades more viable. A powerful and inexpensive weapon but very short-ranged.
