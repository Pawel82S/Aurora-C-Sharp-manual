	Mesons have the following changes for C\# Aurora:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Their cost is based on the same principles as a laser, so mesons will cost the same as an equivalent laser of the same tech level.
		\item Mesons penetrate shields as before but their ability to penetrate armour is now limited.
		\item A new tech line exists, Meson Armour Retardation, which is the chance for each layer of armour to stop the meson. This starts at 50\%, then 40\%, 32\%, etc. finishing at 7\% for TL 12
		\item If armour does stop the meson, it scores 1 point of damage on the armour.
		\item If the meson hits a damaged armour location, it only has to penetrate the remaining armour in that location.
		\item Mesons will destroy missiles without penalty, as missiles are no longer armoured in C\# Aurora.
	\end{enumerate}
	As with everything else, these changes are subject to play test.
