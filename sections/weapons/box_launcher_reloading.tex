	In VB6 Aurora, box launchers can be reloaded in a hangar or at maintenance facilities. For C\# Aurora, box launchers can only be reloaded in a hangar, or at an Ordnance Transfer Point (a Spaceport, Ordnance Transfer Station or Ordnance Transfer Hub). Reloading at an Ordnance Transfer Point is 10x slower than in a hangar (similar to the penalty for maintenance facilities in VB6 Aurora).
	
	Because of the changes to maintenance facilities in C\# Aurora, it will be a lot easier to forward deploy facilities for full-size warships, both on planets and in space, which would increase the potential of box launchers if they could still use those facilities to reload, especially given they are immediately available in C\#. The introduction of ordnance-specific facilities for C\# provides a good alternative.
	
	The existing changes post for Missile Launchers section \ref{missile_launcher_changes} has been updated to take account of this new rule.
