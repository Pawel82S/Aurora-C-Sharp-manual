	At the point when any weapon (energy-based or missile launcher) fires, there is a 1\% chance the weapon will suffer a failure. If sufficient maintenance supplies are available, the weapon will be instantly repaired and will fire normally. If maintenance supplies are not available, the weapon will be damaged and unable to fire.
	
	This is partially to simulate the stress of combat on weapon systems, but also as a balance to other rule changes.
