	This is a copy of a post in the VB6 7.2 Changes List. I didn't release the updated VB6 version so this is still a change from the released VB6 Aurora.
	
	The Particle Lance is a large, potentially devastating weapon that is variant of the Particle Beam.
	
	Once Particle Beam Range 200,000 km and Particle Beam Strength 6 have both been researched, the Particle Lance can be researched for 30,000 RP. The Lance is a modification of the normal Particle Beam and is an extra option in the design window.
	
	The Particle Lance modification affects the Particle Beam in the following ways:\\
	2x Damage\\
	2x Size\\
	2x HTK\\
	2x Crew\\
	2.5x Power Requirement\\
	3x Cost\\
	2x Development Cost
	
	As well as the above modifications, which essentially creates a weapon twice as large, that recharges 2.5x more slowly and costs 3x as much, the damage template of the Particle Lance is a single column of armour, rather than the Particle Beam which has a template between that of missiles and lasers. The Particle Lance retains the constant damage of the Particle Beam, creating a weapon that can penetrate enemy armour at significant range.
	
	Here are examples of similar tech level Particle Beam, Particle Lance and Laser.\\\\

	Two Particle Beams or 25cm Lasers can be installed in the same hull space as the Particle Lance. The Lasers are devastating at close range, the Particle Beams inflict more damage at long range (in terms of DPS), while the Particle Lance penetrates much more armour at long range.
	
	The Particle Lance is intended as a powerful anti-ship weapon that requires a large investment in a particular tech line, lacks the flexibility of lasers or railguns and provides a different armour penetrating option to mesons, although mesons are still superior against shields. Mainly though it is to boost the Particle Beam as a serious weapon choice.
	
	The Particle Lance is not tested under normal battle conditions yet so I may change it a little after play-testing.
